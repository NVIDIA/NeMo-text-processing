It can be among others used to evaluate the context-aware hybrid text normalization under [nemo_text_processing/hybrid](../nemo_text_processing/hybrid/).

It contains 3 datasets:
* EngConf.txt - manually created datasets focusing on ambiguous semiotic tokens where normalization dependends on the context. 
* GoogleTN.json -  derived from [Google Text Normalization test data](https://github.com/rwsproat/text-normalization-data).
* LibriTTS.json - derived from [LibriTTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02882) where normalized text is different from written.
